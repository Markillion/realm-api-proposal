- get player stats call - break out by Profile (MaleTank, FemaleDamage,..) since it's what makes the game unique from other BRs and more classes are planned and it would be a shame to lose that granularity of data when it can just be combined to get the summary per queue by the developer like it is on Smite and Paladins atm.

- Match Details call - would deaths not increment for the times someone gets downed or turned into a chicken? And do you know what this field is for: dropped_out_flag?

- Would it be possible to add the region that the match took place into the top level match object where the match_id and queue stuff is?

- Leaderboards:  Add average kill count? If I understand correctly the highest ranks are based on kill count too.

- Players: As granular as possible so splitting up average_placement is preferred over grouping them.
